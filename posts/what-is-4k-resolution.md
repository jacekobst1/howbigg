## 1. What is 4K Resolution?

4k is an **ultra high screen resolution**.
It can be labelled as _4K_, _UHD_ or _4K UHD_.

It's the most popular TV resolution today, not without reason - it features **impressive image quality**, allowing you to watch the image from closer than ever before!

### Why is it called 4K?

Tke "K" stands for "kilo" - a thousand.
4K refers to a horizontal display resolution that has **approximately 4,000 pixels**.
More specifically, a 4K display typically has a resolution of **3840 x 2160** pixels, which means it has almost 8.3 million pixels in total.

For comparison, a typical 1080p display (Full HD, which was the previous standard for high-definition displays) has a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, so just over 2 million.

### Brief History of 4K Technology

The origins of 4K resolution can be traced back to the early days of digital cinema when filmmakers began experimenting with higher-resolution cameras and displays.
In 2004 [Sony released the first 4K digital cinema projector](https://www.projectorcentral.com/news_story_674.htm), and other manufacturers soon followed suit.

Over time, more and more movies were made in 4k, and more cinemas were buying 4k projectors.
**By the mid-2010s, 4K displays were becoming more common** in consumer electronics, particularly for high-end televisions.

### Advantages of 4K Resolution

So why is 4K resolution so important? Simply put, more pixels mean more detail.
With a 4K display, you'll be **able to see much finer details** in images and videos, particularly in areas with intricate patterns or fine lines.

This can be particularly beneficial for content like nature documentaries or sports broadcasts.
Seeing every blade of grass or individual player on the field can **enhance the viewing experience**.

## 2. How Close Do I Need to Sit to a 4K Screen?

![Chart showing how close you should sit to see the difference between various resolutions](/images/posts/what-is-4k-resolution/optimal_distance_chart.png)
_Howbigg_

The ideal viewing distance of a 4K Ultra HD TV is about **1 to 1.5 times the diagonal width** of the screen.

To fully realize the additional detail and appreciate the full potential of a 4K display, it is not only possible but **recommended to sit closer** to it than you would with a display of lower resolution.

To get the point, let's imagine you are sitting on a couch and looking at three different 100-inch TVs: 720p, 1080p, and 4K.
From the 5 feet distance, you see the quality differences with your naked eye.
However, from 20 yards, you can't notice any difference at all ðŸ˜‰

You can **check the minimal and optimal viewing distances** for your TV more precisely

However, it's worth noting that not all content is available in 4K. Even when it is, you may need a higher-end subscription to access it.

To watch **Netflix in 4K**, you must get **the most pricey** subscription plan!

It's worth mentioning that YouTube is increasingly becoming a source for high-quality 4K videos from independent creators.
Moreover, newer Blu-ray releases frequently include 4K options, and some broadcast television channels are beginning to provide 4K programming.

## 4. 4K vs. UHD: What's the Difference?

**4K resolution, also known as 4K DCI**, is a standard for cinema projection established by the Digital Cinema Initiatives (DCI).
It has a resolution of **4096 x 2160** pixels.
It's called 4K because it is approximately 4,000 pixels wide.

**UHD, or Ultra High Definition**, is a term commonly used in the consumer electronics and television industry.
It has a resolution of **3840 x 2160** pixels, exactly double the horizontal and vertical resolution of Full HD (1920 x 1080 pixels).
It's sometimes also called 2160p or 4K UHD.

4K DCI has an aspect ratio of approximately 1.9:1, while UHD approximately 1.78:1 (16:9) aspect ratio.
This means that **4K DCI is slightly wider and less tall than UHD**, giving it a more cinematic appearance.

While both 4K and UHD refer to high-resolution formats, the key difference lies in the specific resolutions they represent.
UHD is slightly lower in resolution than true 4K.
These two terms are often **used interchangeably in consumer electronics**, as the difference in resolution is minimal and not easily noticeable to the human eye.

## 5. What's Next for 4K Resolution?

Even though 4K screens are still pretty new, there are already talks about even better screens with higher resolutions.
These **8K UHD** screens have a resolution of **7680 x 4320** pixels and are starting to show up in fancy TVs and computer monitors.

It's unclear whether 8K will become the new normal or if 4K will stay popular.
But for now, **4K will likely be a big part of the high-quality screen world** for a while.

## 6. Conclusion

To sum up, 4K resolution **significantly improves detail and sharpness** compared to lower-resolution screens, and it's quickly **becoming the new normal** for high-quality watching.

Even though there are still some hurdles with getting enough 4K content and getting people to use it, 4K screens will **undoubtedly be more and more popular** in the **next few years**.

If you are looking for a new ðŸ“º in 2024, there should be no other option than 4K.
