Are you ready to upgrade your entertainment system, but unsure of what
size TV to get? Finding the **right size TV is crucial for an immersive
viewing experience**. With so many options out there, it can be
overwhelming. But fear not! We're here to help you navigate through the
sea of choices.

There are a few factors you should consider. The dimensions of your
space, the distance between your seating area and the TV, and your
personal preferences all play a role in finding the perfect fit. After
all, you want to make sure that everyone can see every detail without
straining their eyes.

From common sizes like 32-inch 1080p to impressive 85-inch 4K TVs with
stunning picture quality, we'll guide you through it all. So whether
you're looking for a smart TV or seeking recommendations on the best
TVs available, we've got you covered. Let's dive in and discover how
to find the ideal TV size that will bring your favorite shows and movies
to inch life!

## 1. Understanding the Science Behind TV Size and Viewing Distance
Probably most people, when choosing a new TV, measure the width of the
TV cabinet, check the thickness of the wallet, and then go to the store
to choose the largest one that will fit in
the room. This is, unfortunately, a mistake - behind the appropriate
size of the TV is none other than our good old friend from school -
**Mathematics** üßë‚Äçüéì

Mathematics is friends with two powerful colleagues on this subject -
THX and SMPTE.

<div>

- [THX](https://www.thx.com/) is a certification system for video and audio equipment.
- [Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers](https://www.smpte.org/) is an organization that prepares standards and documentation related to television production.

</div>

Both of these fellows have prepared some recommendations as to what viewing
angle our eyes should occupy on the TV screen to make the comfort of our
small entertainment center as high as possible:

<div class="md-border-title">Recommendations</div>

[THX suggests](https://web.archive.org/web/20080724172039/http://www.thx.com/home/setup/display.html) 
that the TV should occupy **28-40** of your field of view.

[SMPTE suggests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimum_HDTV_viewing_distance#Diagonal_measurement_.C3.97_1.6_.28corresponding_to_30-degree_viewing_angle.29)
that the TV should occupy **30** degrees of your field of view.

In addition to this, THX also has [recommendations for the height](https://www.thx.com/questions/where-and-how-should-i-position-my-tv-in-my-living-room/)
at which the TV should be placed. Ideally, the center of the screen should
be **exactly at our eye level**. But if it already has to be higher or
lower, it should be no more than 15 degrees from the horizontal sight
line.

## 2. TV Size Calculator: Finding the Perfect Fit
Don't rely solely on personal judgment and theoretical calculations -
let the TV size calculator do the work for you. With our online tool,
finding the ideal screen size **has never been easier**. By comparing
different TVs, you can ensure an optimal viewing experience without any
guesswork.

Let's start by entering all the necessary information - **diagonal length
and resolution**. Initially, you have the option to complete the data for
only two TVs, but pay attention to the "**Add**" button - by clicking it,
you can increase the number up to six!

In order not to get lost in such a large number of compared TVs, you can
**set the name of each TV** by clicking on the name and typing whatever you
want there.

Once you've entered all the information you need, take a look at the
bottom - there you'll find a visualization of the compared screens and
a table with additional information.

Additional information includes:

- **PPI (Pixels Per Inch)** - an indicator telling us about the density of
    pixels on the screen. Note how different the PPI of FullHD and 4K
    screens are - the difference is as much as twice!

- **Optimal Distance** - Distance at which the display will fill 28 to 40
    degrees of your field of view (based on THX recommendation).

- **Minimal Distance** - The distance below which image quality decreases,
    as your eyes begin to see individual pixels.

## 3. Optimal Display Size for Different Room Sizes:
Choosing the ideal screen size for your TV depends on various factors,
including the size of the room and its intended usage. Here are some key
considerations to help you determine the perfect fit:

- **Recommended screen sizes for small, medium, and large rooms**:
The size of your room plays a crucial role in determining the optimal
TV screen size. For smaller rooms, such as bedrooms or home offices,
a 32 to 43-inch TV may suffice. In medium-sized living rooms or dens,
consider a 50 to 65-inch screen. For larger spaces like dedicated home
theaters, go for a screen size ranging from 70 inches or more.

- **Adjusting screen sizes based on room usage**:
The purpose of the room also influences the ideal screen size. If it's
primarily a living room where you entertain guests and watch movies with
friends and family, opt for larger screens that provide an immersive
experience. On the other hand, if it's a bedroom where you mainly watch
content from the bed, a slightly smaller screen might be suitable.

- **Considering furniture placement and wall-mounting options**:
Take into account how you plan to position your TV within the room. If
you're placing it on a stand or entertainment center, ensure that there
is enough space available to accommodate both the TV and any additional
devices. Alternatively, if you prefer wall-mounting your TV for
space-saving purposes or improved viewing angles, consider factors like
height and distance from seating areas when selecting an appropriate
screen size.

## 4. The Relationship between Screen Resolution and Size:
Image resolution **plays a key role** in how close you can sit to the
screen.

A higher resolution means there are more pixels on the screen. Since the
number of pixels increases while the screen area doesn't change, that
means each pixel is smaller. Since the size of a single pixel is smaller,
it means you have to sit closer in front of the TV to start distinguishing
those single pixels at all.

When you start to see the individual pixels with the naked eye, your enjoyment
of the TV decreases, because the picture is **not as sharp as it should be**.

It is this feature that makes it possible for you to sit much closer in
front of a 4K TV than in front of a Full HD one and still enjoy a great
picture.

Below is a table with the minimum distances from the TV, for Full HD
(1920x1080) and 4K UHD (3840x2160) resolutions:

| TV Size | Full HD Minimum Distance | 4K UHD Minimum Distance |
|---------|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| 40      | 5.07' (1.54m)            | 2.32' (0.71m)           |
| 43      | 5.45' (1.66m)            | 2.5' (0.76m)            |
| 50      | 6.33' (1.93m)            | 2.91' (0.89m)           |
| 55      | 6.97' (2.12m)            | 3.2' (0.97m)            |
| 60      | 7.6' (2.32m)             | 3.49' (1.06m)           |
| 65      | 8.23' (2.51m)            | 3.78' (1.15m)           |
| 70      | 8.87' (2.7m)             | 4.07' (1.24m)           |
| 75      | 9.5' (2.9m)              | 4.36' (1.33m)           |
| 80      | 10.13' (3.09m)           | 4.65' (1.42m)           |
| 85      | 10.76' (3.28m)           | 4.94' (1.51m)           |
| 90      | 11.4' (3.47m)            | 5.23' (1.59m)           |

## 5. Common Mistakes to Avoid When Selecting a TV Size:
### Overlooking the importance of viewing distance in relation to screen size
When choosing the perfect TV size, many people make the mistake of
overlooking the importance of viewing distance. It's crucial to
consider how far you'll be sitting from the screen, as this directly
affects your overall viewing experience. Sitting too close can cause
discomfort and strain on your eyes while sitting too far away might
make it difficult to fully feel the depth of the content.

### Relying solely on personal preferences without considering room dimensions
While personal preferences play a role in selecting a TV size, it's
essential not to disregard room dimensions. A large TV may seem
appealing, but if your space is limited, it could overwhelm the room and
hinder your ability to move around comfortably. On the other hand,
opting for a smaller TV in a spacious room might result in
disappointment due to its lack of impact.

### Ignoring the impact of room lighting conditions on perceived screen size
Room lighting conditions can significantly influence how you perceive
the size of your TV screen. Bright lighting can diminish the visual
impact of a large television, making it appear smaller than it actually
is. Conversely, dim or controlled lighting can enhance the immersive
feel and make even a moderately sized TV seem larger.

### Failing to account for future technological advancements when selecting a TV
Technology is constantly evolving, and TVs are no exception. When
choosing a TV size, it's important to consider future advancements that
may affect your viewing experience. While today's 55-inch TV might seem
sufficient, advancements such as higher resolution or new display
technologies could soon make larger screens more desirable. Planning
ahead ensures that you won't find yourself wanting an upgrade sooner
than anticipated.

## 6. Conclusion: No One Ever Cries With the Right Size

In conclusion, choosing the right size TV is **crucial for an optimal
viewing experience**. Understanding the science behind TV size and viewing
distance is essential to avoid eye strain and discomfort. By considering
factors such as room size, seating arrangement, and personal preference,
you can determine the perfect screen size for your needs.

**Utilizing a TV size calculator can simplify the process** by providing
accurate recommendations based on your specific requirements. This tool
takes into account viewing distance and resolution to ensure a balanced
visual experience.

It's important to note that different room sizes require different TV
screen sizes. A larger living room may necessitate a bigger television
to maintain an immersive atmosphere, while a smaller bedroom might
benefit from a more compact option.

The relationship between screen resolution and TV size should not be
overlooked. Higher resolutions like 4K or 8K offer **sharper images on
larger screens**, enhancing your overall enjoyment.

To avoid common mistakes when selecting a TV size, take into
consideration the **layout of your space** and potential obstructions that
could impact visibility. Measure twice before purchasing to
prevent any regrets later on.

Remember that finding the right size TV is also somewhat subjective and
depends on individual preferences. It's always recommended to **visit a
showroom and read reviews** from trusted sources before making a final
decision.

So don't settle for less! Take control of your entertainment experience
by choosing the right-sized TV for you today!
